                Really nice romantic story. I actually only realized part-way that this was my second time reading it, but it was a nice novel to re-read anyway.

                A cute healing story about a little girl who runs away from her abusive village and disovers the rest of the world. Not an isekai, for the most part.

                Another pretty good season of one of my favorite light novel series. They didn't quite get the awesomeness of the fight scene in the final episode, though.

                Another really cute story. It leans more on the isekai bit than the previous novel, and Ivy becomes a bona-fide Sherlock Holmes.

                Another good volume. This is the first isekai novel (I know of) to give the past memories a small downside; what if a bunch of stuff was actually different from Earth? My favorite joke is 'eggs' actually being a kind of fruit.

                Main game finished. Like the original game, a nice casual platformer. I might enjoy this game more than the original Klonoa because it focuses more on puzzles.

                Mixed feelings about this one. One the one hand, the novel has a pretty interesting concept; multiple reincarnated people is not completely original, but it's still pretty rare. On the other hand, nothing actually really happens in the novel. My prediction for the next volume is that Laura turns out to be reincarnated too.

                Mixed feelings about this one too. The plot is pretty interesting and the main story is actually really good, but the romance subplot feels creepy. Not sure if I'm reading the next volume.

                Still a pretty interesting novel. It's the last part that was adapted for the anime so I already knew what was going to happen, but the light novel goes more into the motivations of the characters.

                This is the first post-anime novel and still a pretty interesting series. The first two-thirds of the book is about a play so it's really surprising when the plot suddenly takes off at the end.

                The original game was already the pinnacle of classic turn-based RPG's, and Royal adds even more cool features on top of that. The only gripes I have with the game is that I'm not too fond of Mementos and I don't like the Velvet Room alarm system.

                It's a pretty good novel, although less eventful than the previous novels. I also feel like the story slows down a lot when they leave the village. Still a lot of cute moments, though.

                Amazing first volume. The characters are interesting, the plot is nice, there are a bunch of funny moments, and everything is well-written. I can't wait to read more of this series.

                This volume is back to having some pretty cool fight scenes and generally more of the stuff I like about this series. This was the end of an arc, though, so I'm curious what happens next.

                Pretty cool story. It's fun to have heroes come back from retirement and see how their age hasn't slowed them down. You also don't see many light novels with 'older' characters.

                Another amazing volume. Even the unlikable character gets likable in this volume, and a new villain is introduced. The main plot point introduced in the first novel is already taken care of so I wonder what the next volume is going to be about.

                Super Mario Wonder is a really fun game. In terms of game design, it's interesting to see a game where every level has its own gimmick that basically isn't reused anywhere else in the game.

                Like the previous volume, this one has a lot of lore. Other than that, there are some scenes of the heroines acting all jealous. The ending might surprise you: of course it ends with a harem instead of the protagonist picking someone. Kind of a low note to end on.

                This one is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story is somewhat interesting with good world-building and it's one of the first isekai novels where the origin world is not Earth. On the other hand, I think the protagonist is pretty boring.

                This was an all-around fun volume. There were some fun moments where the protagonist one-ups the villain. There were some nice heartwarming scenes with Aina and her mother. And a lot of fun scenes with the introduction of Shiro's grandma. The volume also ends with a fun cliffhanger.

                Really cool game with a bunch of interesting mechanics and very satisfying combat. I liked all of the characters and the story is cool with a nice ending. Even though this is only my third Ys game, I still consider myself a fan of the series.

                Really fun volume. At first I thought the part with just the sisters was pretty boring but it quickly picked up speed, culminating in a great arc with an actual villain and interesting things happening.

                Another great volume. This writer seems to have really found his groove. The story basically has the same structure as last volume: a bunch of new characters are introduced in a humorous context and are then thrust into more serious situations.

                It was my first time playing it and I can really see why so many people like it. Most of the game was really great, although I didn't like any of the platforming sections because the isometric perspective doesn't mesh well with platforming. I love the quirky games that result when Nintendo lets other companies use their characters.

                An interesting volume; at first it seemed like the novel would just introduce a new character and go with that, but then they suddenly used those new characters as an excuse to turn the novel into a travel story. I generally like travel stories because it allows for good world-building, so I'm looking forward to future volumes.

                Pretty fun isekai novel. Instead of having a great superpower, the protagonist's powers are basically a bit of modern knowledge and being a nice person. The novel starts out with a bit of high society and then becomes a strategy and tower defense story.
